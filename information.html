            <h1>Tulfo’s erroneous reading of RA 10630</h1>
            <p>RAMON TULFO gravely erred in his column “Live and let live policy, if Binay is elected” (Metro, 1/28/16).

                Under the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act, children aged 15 and below who commit a serious offense are mandatorily placed for a period of not less than one year in the Intensive Juvenile Intervention and Support Center (IJISC) within the youth care facility called Bahay Pag-asa. These children are not to be released and have to undergo intensive rehabilitation and intervention as determined by the multidisciplinary team of the IJISC. Also, the law clearly states that “the exemption from criminal liability herein established does not include exemption from civil liability, which shall be enforced in accordance with existing laws.”
                
                Strengthening the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act, amendments introduced by former senator Francis Pangilinan were signed into law, Republic Act No. 10630, in July 2013. Apart from the establishment of the IJISC, the law clarified procedures for children below the minimum age of criminal responsibility, including those who commit serious offenses. The law states that any child aged 12 to 15 who commits a serious offense punishable by more than 12 years imprisonment should be deemed a neglected child under the Child and Youth Welfare Code. As a neglected child, the minor should be placed in the IJISC. The social welfare officer of the local government unit where the crime was committed or the social worker of the Department of Social Welfare and Development is required to file a petition in the court for the involuntary confinement of the minor in the IJISC where the child is to undergo appropriate intervention programs.

                <h2>The DSWD: Steering the Course of Juvenile Justice in the Philippines</h2>
                <p>Republic Act No. 10630, the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2013, marked a paradigm shift in the Philippines' approach to children in conflict with the law (CICLs). At the helm of this transformative legislation stands the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), playing a multifaceted and central role in its implementation. The DSWD's involvement in R.A. 10630 cannot be overstated. They are the architects, builders, and guardians of a system that prioritizes the welfare and rehabilitation of CICLs. Through their leadership, direct services, advocacy, and research efforts, they steer the course of juvenile justice in the Philippines, fostering a future where rehabilitation, restorative justice, and community support pave the way for a brighter future for CICLs and the communities they return to.</p>
              
                <h3>Standing Alongside Justice: The Public Attorneys' Office and R.A. 10630</h3> 
                <p>The Public Attorneys' Office (PAO) plays a crucial role in upholding the rights and welfare of children in conflict with the law (CICLs) under Republic Act No. 10630, the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2013. 
                    One of R.A. 10630's core principles is ensuring a fair and balanced legal process for CICLs. Many CICLs come from underprivileged backgrounds and cannot afford private legal counsel. This is where the PAO steps in, providing free legal representation to CICLs throughout the legal process, from pre-trial investigations to court proceedings. PAO lawyers advocate for the rights of CICLs, ensuring their voices are heard and their legal options are explored. Their dedication helps level the playing field and guarantees that every CICL has access to a competent and passionate legal defense.
                    Beyond legal representation, the PAO provides crucial support and guidance to CICLs and their families. PAO lawyers explain the complexities of the legal system, answer questions, and address anxieties during a confusing and emotional time. They may also connect CICLs with social services, educational resources, and other forms of support to help them navigate the challenges they face during and after the legal process. This holistic approach empowers CICLs to participate actively in their own defense and paves the way for a smoother reintegration into society.
