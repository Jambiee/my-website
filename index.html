    <h1>R.A. 10630: Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Republic Act No. 10630, also known as the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2013, is a key legislation in the Philippines that establishes a comprehensive framework for dealing with children in conflict with the law (CICLs). Here's a summary of its key provisions:

        <br>Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility (MACR):<br>
        
        <br>Under RA 10630, the MACR is 15 years old. Children younger than 15 are exempt from criminal liability for any offense they commit.
        However, they may be subjected to intervention programs aimed at their rehabilitation and development.
        Discernment Test:<br>
        
        <br>Children between 15 and 18 years old can still be exempted from criminal liability if they lack discernment, meaning they do not fully understand the wrongfulness of their actions.
        A multi-disciplinary team will assess the child's capacity for discernment based on psychological, social, and behavioral factors.
        Intervention Programs:<br>
        
        <br>For CICLs deemed exempt from criminal liability, RA 10630 emphasizes intervention programs focused on rehabilitation, education, and social reintegration.
        These programs may include counseling, skills training, community service, and placement in residential care facilities called Bahay Pag-asa.
        Due Process and Rights of CICLs:<br>
        
        <br>RA 10630 guarantees CICLs due process rights, including the right to legal representation, confidentiality, and protection from harmful treatment.
        The Act also emphasizes restorative justice principles, seeking to repair the harm caused to victims and communities.
        Parental Responsibility:<br>
        
        <br>Parents or guardians of CICLs can be held liable for damages caused by their children's actions, unless they can demonstrate reasonable supervision and effort to prevent them.
        The Act also encourages parental participation in intervention programs and court proceedings.
        Impact of RA 10630:<br>
        
        <br>RA 10630 has been praised for its focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice, shifting the emphasis away from punishment and incarceration for CICLs.
        However, challenges remain in implementing the Act effectively, including ensuring adequate resources for intervention programs and trained personnel to handle CICL cases.</p>
