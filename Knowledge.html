            <h1>R.A. 10630: Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System</h1>
            <p>Republic Act No. 10630, also known as the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2013, is a key legislation in the Philippines that establishes a comprehensive framework for dealing with children in conflict with the law (CICLs). Here's a summary of its key provisions:

                <br>Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility (MACR):<br>
                
               <br> Under RA 10630, the MACR is 15 years old. Children younger than 15 are exempt from criminal liability for any offense they commit.
                However, they may be subjected to intervention programs aimed at their rehabilitation and development.
                Discernment Test:<br>
                
                <br>Children between 15 and 18 years old can still be exempted from criminal liability if they lack discernment, meaning they do not fully understand the wrongfulness of their actions.
                A multi-disciplinary team will assess the child's capacity for discernment based on psychological, social, and behavioral factors.
                Intervention Programs:<br>
                
                <br>For CICLs deemed exempt from criminal liability, RA 10630 emphasizes intervention programs focused on rehabilitation, education, and social reintegration.
                These programs may include counseling, skills training, community service, and placement in residential care facilities called Bahay Pag-asa.</p>
